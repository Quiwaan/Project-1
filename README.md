# Project-1

This is battleship but a different kind of battlship! in all battleship games there are 17 hits to battleships to win the game!
this will be a little different, do you remember the game Minesweeper? this will be battlesweeper! 

If you would like you when you place your ships you can put them together to get bigger ships.

I will be updating this game bit by bit till it is a full working battlship game the way i like it! So stay tuned for updates
